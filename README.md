# Remake-Projects

Welcome to **Remake-Projects** â€“ a collection of apps and games I've rebuilt from scratch to improve my coding skills, experiment with different technologies, and explore how popular projects are structured behind the scenes.

Each subfolder contains a remake of a familiar app or game, created using my own code and design. Some are simple recreations, while others include additional features or improvements.

This repo serves as my personal lab for remaking and learning, and whenever a project is polished enough, I may release it as a standalone repository.

## ðŸš€ Projects Included

- ðŸŽ² **Slagalica** â€“ popular Serbian TV game show ["Slagalica"](https://slagalica.tv) with games like Moj Broj, Spojnice, Skocko and more (in progress)

## ðŸ“Œ Why Remakes?

- To understand how real-world projects work under the hood  
- To practice building UI, logic, and architecture from scratch  
- To learn by doing â€“ and to have fun doing it
